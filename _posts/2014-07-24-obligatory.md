Obligatory first post. Awkward...


My work revolves around understanding the mechanisms behind the formation, and later plasticity, of memory. I love data exploration and visualization. I hope to use this blog as an outlet for when inspiration hits. 

I've opted to use Jekyll + github.io for hosting + twitter bootstrap.

Thanks to [yeswejekyll](http://yeswejekyll.com) for the initial Jekyll setup.
