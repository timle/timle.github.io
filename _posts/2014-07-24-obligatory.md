Obligatory first post. Awkward...

I love data exploration and visualization. This blog is an outlet for when inspiration hits. 

I really like the idea of being able to write posts in markdown. So For the blog I have opted to use [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) as backend + [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting. For layout [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) was an easy choice, having worked with it in the past.

Thanks to [yeswejekyll](http://yeswejekyll.com) for the initial Jekyll and Bootstrap setup.
